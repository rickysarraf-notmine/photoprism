// Rotation angles for face regions' face detection (in degrees).
//
// The most probable reason why an exif face region could not be detected by PhotoPrism seems to be that the face region
// is at a weird angle. To support such angled face regions, a fallback has been added, which kicks in when no embeddings
// can be computed for an exif face region. In this case, face detetion is ran for a list of user-configured rotation angles
// and it's checked whether any detected face significatly overlaps with the exif face region.
//
// During testing the following rotation angles have been identified as good candidates: 72째, 252째 and 288째 (in addition to 0째).
// However per default, the image will not be rotated, as any configured angle will cause additional computational overhead,
// so it is left up to the user to configure meaningful values based on the photos in their collection.
